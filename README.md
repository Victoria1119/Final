The Smart Home Device Manager is a Java based application designed to allow users to set up and control devices 
within different rooms in their homes. This program allows users to create rooms, assign two smart devices 
(lighting and thermostat) to each room, control the settings for the devices, and control their power state. 
This program uses encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to create a modular management system.  
The application focuses on only two devices, lighting and thermostats. This is to demonstrate the modular management 
system of the program, but it can be expanded to include other devices such as speaker systems or televisions.
